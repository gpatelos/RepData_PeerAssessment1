## Here we will load and pre-process the data

```{r loaddata}
unzip(zipfile="activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}

# splitting to isolate steps by day
splitSteps <- split(data$steps, data$date)
totalsplitSteps <- sapply(splitSteps, sum, na.rm=TRUE)

hist(totalsplitSteps, main="steps by day", xlab="Date (Oct to Nov 2012)", ylab="Frequency", lwd=4, col="yellow", breaks = 15)

# mean steps per day

mean(totalsplitSteps, na.rm=TRUE)

# median steps per day

median(totalsplitSteps, na.rm=TRUE)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
